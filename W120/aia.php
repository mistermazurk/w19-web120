  <td><b>Hip millennials: </b>
  <br>
Style concientious men & women in thier mid 20's to 30's who value the charms of vintage watches and jewelry. Tech savey and scrutinizing this is an important demographic to appeal to in terms of web design, functionality and marketing; if the site is pleasing to them, it will most likely be pleasing to the rest of the audience as well. Mostly uses mobile devices and macintosh products.</td>

    <td><b>Middle aged men & women (Gen X + Boomers):</b>
    <br>
    This generation, people in their 60's to 40's, will remember the vintage products the client sells and repairs as much of it is from their heyday. Computer skills will range in this group from professionals to absolute illiteracy so intutitveness is a priority in design. Most likely PC users but some Mac and mobile useage as well.
    </td>
      <td><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>tech illiteracy calls for simple and intuitive design to make access easy for aging customers</li>
  <li>nostalgia is a large selling point, especially to gen x as they grow older</li>
  </ul>
  </td>

     <td><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Simple and intutive design and response</li>
  <li>SEO optimization (many likely utilize google, yahoo, etc.) and some social media</li>

    <td><b>Watch collectors and enthusiasts:</b>
    <br>
    I assume this group will be the most diverse in terms of age range but not in income, as watch collecting is an expensive hobby; this is the target demographic. This group will be the most scrutinizing in terms of appearance of being a professional, so design is important here but not in the same way from the other groups, we must project a professional air in order to secure their business as they will likely have experience with watch makers and jewelers and will have a specific criteria in their mind of what constitutes a professional. Mac, PC, mobile, etc (all platforms).
    </td>
      <td><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>must appear and prove professionalism in all aspects of the operation</li>
  <li>competative pricing and quality control is essential as they will be shopping competing jewelers</li>
  </ul>
  </td>

      <td><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>competative pricing</li>
  <li>ensure the appearance of professionalism and knowledge that this audience will expect</li>
  <li>maintain an enticing supply of quality product at competative pricing</li>
  <li>will most likely need to acquire a supplier once business/reputation grows to keep up with demand </li>
