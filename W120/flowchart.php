 <p>My name is Lee Mazurk.</p>
 <p>I went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas Highschool In Parkland, FL and the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. My hobbies include (but are not limited to): reading books, playing video games, following professional and collegiate sports and watching movies. I've always been facinated by computers and now I'm finally learning about them in-depth. So far in my studies I have gravitated towards web development.</p>
